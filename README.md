Basic implementation of **TypeScript** with **Webpack 5**. I also set up **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code linting and formatting.

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/rossanodan/typescript-webpack-playground.git
cd typescript-webpack-playground
npm i
```

### Running the code locally with the watcher in development mode

```
npm run build:watch
node src/main.js
```

### Building the code in production mode

```
npm run build
node src/main.js
```
